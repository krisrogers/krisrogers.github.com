    <p class="category-description">
      I have acquired almost ten years experience as a professional software engineer working in high-responsibility roles on a range of projects. During this time, I have had extensive involvement in full stack, full life-cycle development of web-based data analytics products.<br>
      <br>
      I have cultivated a diverse gamut of skills, but find myself most fascinated with: product design, interactive data visualisation, complex algorithm R&D, computational modelling and knowledge discovery.<br>

    <h2 class="category-headers">Philosophy</h2><hr>
    <p class="category-description">
      I consider myself a highly motivated person on a lifelong quest to learn, adapt and evolve. I have an intense hunger for discovery and creativity and enjoy exploring different modalities of thought and perception in order to expand my understanding. I revel in the challenge of even the most daunting tasks.

        <ul class="category-details">
          <li>
            Complete UI overhaul, which formed the basis of a major version release; Utilised technologies such as ExtJS, RaphaelJS, D3.js.
          </li>
          <li>
            Design (in collabaration with client input) and implementation of extensive quantitative PDF reporting in Java.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented a multi-threaded web scraper in Python with REST API wrapper.
          </li>
