    <hr>
    <p class="category-description">
      I have acquired almost ten years experience as a professional software engineer working in high-responsibility roles on a range of projects. During this time, I have had extensive involvement in full stack, full life-cycle development of web-based data analytics products.<br>
      <br>
      I have cultivated a diverse gamut of skills but find myself most fascinated with: product design, interactive data visualisation, complex algorithm R&D and knowledge discovery. I have explored a variety of technologies but my strongest proficiencies reside in Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and frameworks/libraries such as NumPy, Django, Scrapy, pytest, D3.js, jQuery, Bootstrap, Foundation and Compass.<br>
    </p>
    <h2 class="category-headers">Philosophy</h2><hr>
    <p class="category-description">
      I consider myself a highly motivated person on a lifelong quest to learn, adapt and evolve. I have an intense hunger for discovery and creativity and enjoy exploring different modalities of thought and perspective in order to expand my understanding. I revel in the challenge of even the most daunting tasks.

        <p class="category-details">Founder, Chief Architect<br>January 2013 - Present</p>
        <p class="category-description">As co-founder and chief architect of Kapiche, I have been heavily involved in research & development underpinning the creation of a cutting-edge Python-based text-indexing & analytics platform. Moreover, I have held an essential role in the development of our web-based knowledge discovery and research tool. Key activities have included:</p>
        <ul class="category-details">
          <li>
            Research academic papers to devise and implement novel algorithms for knowledge mining of textual data. Optimise algorithmic performance using NumPy, Cython, and CPU & memory profiling techniques.
          </li>
          <li>
            Design and rapid-prototyping of bespoke data analytics products across varied domains (search, market research, finance), utilising web technologies such as Compass, Knockout.js, D3.js, Foundation, jQuery, Django, Flask.
          </li>
          <li>
            Extensive reflection and brainstorming to conceive high-level design strategies for our knowledge discovery & research tool. Design and implementation of advanced, interactive data visualisations for exploration of qualitative, textual data.

        <p class="category-details">Software Engineer<br>July 2008 - February 2013</p>
        <p class="category-description">During my time at Leximancer I found myself working on a variety of challenging and interesting projects, quickly proving my ability to plan and execute the implementation of sophisticated technical solutions through effective self-management and collaboration with the team.<br>
        <br>
        Initially, I made significant contributions to the company's flagship text analytics SaaS product, including:</p>
        <ul class="category-details">
          <li>
            Complete UI overhaul, which formed the basis of a major version release; Utilised technologies such as ExtJS, RaphaelJS, D3.js.
          </li>
          <li>
            Design and implementation of extensive quantitative PDF & HTML reporting in Java using iText.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented a multi-threaded web crawler in Python that supported conditional recursion and scraping based on configurable regular expressions. Also, implemented REST API wrapper for utilisation by commercial text analytics software.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="category-description">Subsequently, I was given increasing responsibility to develop bespoke applications in direct consultation with customers. Major projects included:</p>
        <ul class="category-details">
          <li>Lead the development of recurrence analysis software that is the result of ongoing research at the University of Queensland. The software was built as both a SaaS offering and desktop product using technologies such as Python, Django, MongoDB, CherryPy, JavaScript, ExtJS, RaphaelJS, D3.js.</li>
          <li>As part of a federal grant, implemented a hierarchical codebook classification system to
  automatically identify and describe counter-terrorism events within documents both uploaded
  and fetched from web sources (blogs, government websites). I was also responsible for the creation of a comprehensive software specification document as part of the initial tender process.</li>
          <li>Designed and implemented a browser-based software prototype for analysing trends in Twitter
  data. Utilised JavaScript and D3.js to provide multiple interactive data visualisations. Created command-
  line tools in Python to search, download and process Tweets via the Twitter API.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="category-details">Software Engineer<br>December 2006 - June 2008</p>
        <p class="category-description">Beginning my professional career at Daesim, I developed and contributed to commercial Java web applications for management and maintenance of control systems. After a short period of contribution to an existing Struts-based application, I moved on to a more autonomous role, leading the development of projects such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="category-details">
        <li>A real-time activity scheduling application for a coke-making plant utilising Java, Struts and Oracle. It supported dynamic views of the database by providing users with a bespoke, JavaScript-based Query builder interface.</li>
        <li>A risk assessment prototype using ExtJS and RaphaelJS that provided advanced, interaction-driven functionality such as drag-and-drop style construction of complex system schematics.</li>
      </ul>
